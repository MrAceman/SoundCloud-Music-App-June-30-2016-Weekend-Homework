## SoundCloud Music Player - Ajax call, use of native audio player, and simple sorting of results.

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created over the weekend of June 30th through July 4th, 2016.  The goal was to create an application that communicated with SoundCloud, requested songs based on a search string, and allow playing of those results through the native browser audio player.  Additionally, "hard mode" included searching of the results in ascending/decsending alphabetical order.

The primary purposes of this exercise were to work on connecting to a 3rd party web service through that party's API and displaying the received JSON data.  Also, use of the native audio player was used and minor use of the lodash JS library.
